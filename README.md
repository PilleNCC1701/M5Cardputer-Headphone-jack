# M5Cardputer-Headphone-jack
Small Modification of my M5Cardputer.
I´ll make a tutorial with pictures soon. 

What I´ve done:
- bypassed the I2S connection to the build-in mono amp and moved it outside into a XH-5Y socket.

- modded the M5 backdside of the case for fit the XH-5Y socket throgh.

- soldered a XH-5Y plug direktly on a PCM5102, whitch is a Stereo DAC with I2S
- modded the frontside of the M5 case for fit a dip switch through.
- added a dip switch for muting the internal speaker.
- cut the negative speaker wire and installed in between one of the switch for muting the speaker
  to be able to listen on my own.
